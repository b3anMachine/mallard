# Mallard!
Mallard! is an arcade-style video game that plays like Breakout. I built this to gain practice in game design, OOD design patterns, and Java. I plan to update this readme and go into detail on those concepts I explored. In the meanwhile, feel free to look around. 

If you're on a Mac, you can grab the initial release. Due to Apple’s latest security measures, you will have to disable Gatekeeper in System Preferences (*Security & Privacy* / *Allow apps downloaded from* -> *Anywhere*). If you are on Sierra or above, this option is hidden by default. You can run the following command to unhide it. 
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
Otherwise, Mac OS will warn you—rather dramatically—that the app is “Damaged" and "should be moved to the Trash”

You can re-hide the option with this command:
```
sudo spctl --master-enable
```
